# Pipeline flow:

# Code Fetching and Build:
Jenkins is configured to pull the latest code from a GitHub repository.
The fetched code is then built using Maven.
If the Maven build fails, Jenkins sends a failure notification to a Slack channel to alert the team.

# Artifact Storage:
If the build is successful, the generated artifact is stored in a Nexus repository for versioning and artifact management.

# Static Code Analysis with SonarQube:
Jenkins triggers a SonarQube scan on the built artifact to analyze the code for quality, security vulnerabilities, and coding standards.
After the scan completes, the SonarQube reports are generated and sent to a designated Slack channel for review.

# Containerization:
Jenkins then uses Docker to build a container image from the artifact.
The Docker image is scanned for security vulnerabilities using Trivy, ensuring that any known security issues in the image are detected and flagged.

# Docker Image Storage:
After successful scanning with Trivy, the image is pushed to a private Docker Hub repository for centralized storage.

# Deployment to Kubernetes:
The Docker image is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Jenkins, ensuring efficient management and scaling of containerized applications.
Kubernetes handles the orchestration and management of the deployed contain# CI-CD-pipeline-DevSecOps

# Docker Image Storage:
After successful scanning with Trivy, the image is pushed to a private Docker Hub repository for centralized storage.

# Deployment to Kubernetes:
The Docker image is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Jenkiners.

# Monitoring and Alerts:
Prometheus is used to monitor the health and performance of the deployed application and the Kubernetes cluster.
Grafana is configured for visualization and dashboards, providing insights into application metrics, system performance, and cluster status.

If any alerts are triggered (e.g., resource utilization, application failures, etc.), notifications are sent to a Slack channel to immediately notify the team of potential issues.

This comprehensive pipeline ensures an automated, efficient, and secure CI/CD process, with real-time feedback and monitoring for proactive issue resolution.

# Here is a list of prerequisite tools for implementing the described pipeline:

# Jenkins:
Jenkins should be installed and configured for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) automation.
The Jenkins GitHub Plugin is required to pull code from the GitHub repository.
Install and configure Maven in Jenkins for building Java projects.

# GitHub:
A GitHub repository to store your applicationâ€™s source code.
A personal access token or SSH key for Jenkins to securely access the repository.

# Maven:
Maven must be installed on the Jenkins server to build Java projects.
The correct Maven configurations (e.g., pom.xml file) should be set in the GitHub repository for building.

# Slack:
A Slack workspace and Slack webhook integration for receiving notifications from Jenkins, SonarQube, Prometheus, etc.
Create channels for build notifications, SonarQube reports, and monitoring alerts.

# Nexus Repository Manager:
A Nexus repository (either hosted or on-premise) to store built artifacts such as JAR/WAR files.
Configure Nexus credentials in Jenkins to upload artifacts securely.

# SonarQube:
SonarQube should be installed for static code analysis.
Install the SonarQube Jenkins plugin to integrate Jenkins with SonarQube.
Configure SonarQube scanner on Jenkins to trigger the analysis after the Maven build.

# Docker:
Install Docker on the Jenkins server to build and scan Docker images.
Set up a Docker Hub account to store images in a private repository.
Install the Trivy tool to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

# Trivy:
Trivy should be installed on the Jenkins server or Docker environment for vulnerability scanning of Docker images.
Trivy needs proper configuration to scan for known vulnerabilities.

# Kubernetes:
A Kubernetes cluster should be available (either on-premises or via a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure).
Install the kubectl tool on Jenkins to deploy containers to Kubernetes.
Set up Kubernetes credentials in Jenkins for secure access to the cluster.

#Prometheus:
Prometheus should be installed in the Kubernetes cluster to monitor application metrics and resources.
Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your applications and Kubernetes nodes.

#Grafana:
Install Grafana for visualizing metrics and logs from Prometheus.
Configure Grafana dashboards to display key performance indicators (KPIs) and health metrics of the application.

# Slack Notifications Setup:
Install and configure the Slack Notification Plugin in Jenkins for sending build status updates and SonarQube reports to Slack.
